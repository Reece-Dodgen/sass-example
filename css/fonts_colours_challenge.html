     <p>All that is told here happened some time before
       Mowgli was turned out of the Seeonee Wolf Pack, or
       revenged himself on Shere Khan the tiger. It was in the
       days when Baloo was teaching him the Law of the Jungle.
       The big, serious, old brown bear was delighted to have so
       quick a pupil, for the young wolves will only learn as
       much of the Law of the Jungle as applies to their own
       pack and tribe, and run away as soon as they can repeat
       the Hunting Verse —‘Feet that make no noise; eyes that
       can see in the dark; ears that can hear the winds in their
       lairs, and sharp white teeth, all these things are the marks
       of our brothers except Tabaqui the Jackal and the Hyaena
       whom we hate.’ But Mowgli, as a man-cub, had to learn a
       great deal more than this. Sometimes Bagheera the Black
        Panther would come lounging through the jungle to see
       how his pet was getting on, and would purr with his head
       against a tree while Mowgli recited the day’s lesson to
       Baloo. The boy could climb almost as well as he could
       swim, and swim almost as well as he could run. So Baloo,
       the Teacher of the Law, taught him the Wood and Water Laws: how to tell a   rotten branch from a sound one; how
       to speak politely to the wild bees when he came upon a
       hive of them fifty feet above ground; what to say to Mang
       the Bat when he disturbed him in the branches at midday;
       and how to warn the water-snakes in the pools before he
       splashed down among them. None of the Jungle People
       like being disturbed, and all are very ready to fly at an
       intruder. Then, too, Mowgli was taught the Strangers’
       Hunting Call, which must be repeated aloud till it is
       answered, whenever one of the Jungle-People hunts
       outside his own grounds. It means, translated, ‘Give me
       leave to hunt here because I am hungry.’ And the answer
       is, ‘Hunt then for food, but not for pleasure.’

   <h1>All this will</h1>

     <p>show you how much Mowgli had to learn
     by heart, and he grew very tired of saying the same thing
     over a hundred times.</p> <p>But, as Baloo said to Bagheera, one
     day when Mowgli had been cuffed and run off in a
     temper, ‘A man’s cub is a man’s cub, and he must learn all
     the Law of the Jungle.’</p> <p>But think howsmall he is,’ said the Black      Panther,
     who would have spoiled Mowgli if he had had his own
     way.</p> <p>‘How can his little head carry all thy long talk?’</p> <p>‘Is  there anything in the jungle too little to be killed?</p>

   <h2>No. That is</h2>

     <p>why I teach him these things, and that is why
     I hit him, very softly, when he forgets.’</p>
     <p>‘Softly! What dost thou know of softness, old Ironfeet?’
     Bagheera grunted.</p> <p>‘His face is all bruised today by
     thy— softness. Ugh.’</p> <p>be bruised from head to foot by me
     who love him than that he should come to harm through
     ignorance,’ Baloo answered very earnestly.</p> <p>‘I am now teaching him the Master Words of the Jungle that shall
     protect him with the birds and the Snake People, and all
     that hunt on four feet, except his own pack. He can now
     claim protection, if he will only remember the words,
     from all in the jungle.</p>

   <h3>Is not that</h3>

     <p>worth a little beating?’ ‘Well, look to it then that thou dost not kill   the mancub.</p>
     <p>He is no tree trunk to sharpen thy blunt claws upon.
     But what are those Master Words?</p> <p>I am more likely to
     give help than to ask it’ —Bagheera stretched out one paw
     and admired the steel-blue, ripping-chisel talons at the end
     of it—‘still I should like to know.’</p> <p>is ringing like a bee tree,’     said a sullen little
     voice over their heads, and Mowgli slid down a tree trunk
     very angry and indignant, adding as he reached the
     ground: ‘I come for Bagheera and not for thee, fat old
     Baloo!’</p>

   <h4>My head is</h4>

     <p>is ringing like a bee tree,’ said a sullen little
     voice over their heads, and Mowgli slid down a tree trunk
     very angry and indignant, adding as he reached the
     ground: ‘I come for Bagheera and not for thee, fat old
     Baloo!’</p> <p>‘That is all one to me,’ said Baloo, though he was hurt
     and grieved. ‘Tell Bagheera, then, the Master Words of
     delighted to show off. ‘The jungle has many tongues. I
     know them all.’</p> <p>‘A little thou knowest, but not much. See, O Bagheera,
     they never thank their teacher. Not one small wolfling has
     ever come back to thank old Baloo for his teachings.</p> <p>Say the word for the Hunting-People, then—great scholar.’
     ‘We be of one blood, ye and I,’ said Mowgli, giving
     the words the Bear accent which all the Hunting People
     use.</p>

   <h5>Good. Now for</h5>

     <p>the birds.’ Mowgli repeated, with the Kite’s whistle at the end of
     the sentence.
     ‘Now for the Snake-People,’ said Bagheera.</p> <p>
     The answer was a perfectly indescribable hiss, and
     Mowgli kicked up his feet behind, clapped his hands
     together to applaud himself, and jumped on to Bagheera’s
     back, where he sat sideways, drumming with his heels on
     the glossy skin and making the worst faces he could think
     of at Baloo.</p> <p>There—there! that was worth a little bruise,’ said the
     brown bear tenderly.</p> <p>‘Some day thou wilt remember me.’
     Then he turned aside to tell Bagheera how he had begged
     the Master Words from Hathi the Wild Elephant, who
     knows all about these things, and how Hathi had taken
     Mowgli down to a pool to get the Snake Word from a
     water-snake, because Baloo could not pronounce it, and
     how Mowgli was now reasonably safe against all accidents
     hurt him.</p> <p>‘No one then is to be feared,’ Baloo wound up, patting
     his big furry stomach with pride.</p>
